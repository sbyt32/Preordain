# MTG Price Fetcher
> A simple price and sale fetcher for Magic: The Gathering, powered via Scryfall and TCGPlayer's API and written in Python. Front-end written using SvelteKit


You can use the docker-compose file to deploy the project. However, there will not be any data in the project so your mileage may vary.
<!-- Start the API with...
```
    pip install -r requirements-base.txt
    hypercorn preordain.main:app
``` -->
Written documentation is a WIP. Location is currently [here](docs/api_functions.md). More functions will be added and documented over time.
